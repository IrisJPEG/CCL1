## ✍️ Reflection

### What Went Well
- **Responsive Paddle Control**: Moving the paddle with mouse input provided intuitive gameplay, and adding different reflection angles based on the place of collision on the paddle gave the game sence of needed skill.
- **Hearts for Extra Tries**: Introducing heart pickups gave players more chances to win the game.
- **Visuals**: I enjoyed giving my game a goofy representation and I think I have succeeded

### Challenges
- **Balancing Difficulty**: Tuning the number of obstacles and the velocity increments was challenging.
- **Collision Precision**: Handling edge collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks..

### Lessons Learned
- **Incremental Design**: Starting with a minimal Breakout game and gradually adding features (hearts, velocity boosts, additional rows) helped maintain code clarity.
- **User-Focused Iteration**: Playtest feedback on control sensitivity and obstacle layout guided our final difficulty settings.
