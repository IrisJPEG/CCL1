## 🎨 Spritesheets

*(Note: In this project, we use sprite animations for the ball, obstacles, and paddle. Below are example placeholders if you had specific character or NPC sprites.)*

## ✍️ Reflection

### What Went Well
- **Responsive Paddle Control**: Moving the paddle with mouse input provided smooth, intuitive gameplay.
- **Hearts for Extra Tries**: Introducing heart pickups gave players more incentive and excitement to continue.
- **Visual Feedback**: Animations for hitting the paddle or colliding with obstacles created a polished feel.

### Challenges
- **Balancing Difficulty**: Tuning the number of obstacles and the velocity increments was challenging.
- **Collision Precision**: Handling edge collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks required careful math and testing.

### Lessons Learned
- **Incremental Design**: Starting with a minimal Breakout clone and gradually adding features (hearts, velocity boosts, additional rows) helped maintain code clarity.
- **User-Focused Iteration**: Playtest feedback on control sensitivity and obstacle layout guided our final difficulty settings.
