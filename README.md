🎮 Code Breaker: Destroyer of Bugs
Short Pitch: A modern twist on the classic Breakout-style gameplay. Use your “keyboard” paddle to squash bugs (obstacles), collect hearts for extra lives, and outscore your own high score!

(Note: In this project, we use sprite animations for the ball, obstacles, and paddle. Below are example placeholders if you had specific character or NPC sprites.)

✍️ Reflection
What Went Well
Responsive Paddle Control: Moving the paddle with mouse input provided smooth, intuitive gameplay.
Hearts for Extra Tries: Introducing heart pickups gave players more incentive and excitement to continue.
Visual Feedback: Animations for hitting the paddle or colliding with obstacles created a polished feel.
Challenges
Balancing Difficulty: Tuning the number of obstacles and the velocity increments was challenging.
Collision Precision: Handling edge collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks required careful math and testing.
Lessons Learned
Incremental Design: Starting with a minimal Breakout clone and gradually adding features (hearts, velocity boosts, additional rows) helped maintain code clarity.
User-Focused Iteration: Playtest feedback on control sensitivity and obstacle layout guided our final difficulty settings.

Happy Bug Hunting! 🐛🪓
