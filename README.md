## ✍️ Reflection

### What Went Well
- **Reflection angles from paddle**: Adding different reflection angles based on the place of collision on the paddle gave the game needed sence of skill.
- **Hearts for Extra Tries**: Introducing heart pickups gave players more chances to win the game.
- **Visuals**: I enjoyed giving my game a goofy representation and I think I have succeeded.

### Challenges
- **Debugging**: Debugging my code, especially dealing with collision bugs and unexpected ball behaviours.
- **Game progression**: Trying to find a way to make each level a bit harder, without making it too difficult.

### Lessons Learned
- **Incremental Design**: Starting with a minimal Breakout game and gradually adding features (hearts, velocity boosts, additional rows) helped keep the code functional as I progressed.
- **User-Focused Iteration**: Letting my friends play the game helped me determine the right difficulty, as after testing it my self 1000 times my opinion was biased.
