13. 1. On this day I planned out what i want to focus on first. I changed my original plan and decided to make a brick breaker game. My plan was following
       1. make functional prototype including movement of the ball, paddle I can control with my mouse and collision of bricks with ball.

14. 1. today i started working on win and lose scenario as well as a start screen. I resolved some bugs, but I still got more to deal with (ball getting stuck in canvas edge etc.)
16.1. today i started working on animations, sadly one  of the most time consuming concepts proved to be way to detailed for the size of the object in game, so even though its a really cool animation, i have to get rid of it for now and start fresh. other then that I started implementing other animations.
