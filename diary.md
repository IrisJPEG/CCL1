13. 1. On this day I planned out what i want to focus on first. I changed my original plan and decided to make a brick breaker game. My plan was following
       1. make functional prototype including movement of the ball, paddle I can control with my mouse and collision of bricks with ball. I added high score and current score.

14. 1. today i started working on win and lose scenario as well as a start screen. I resolved some bugs, but I still got more to deal with (ball getting stuck in canvas edge etc.) I made sure the game resets once the ball misses the paddle and hits the bottom showing a lose screen.
   
       15. 1. I have finally settled on a theme. After strugling quite bad with a few bugs, I decided to make my brick breaker a game about destroying bugs in your code!
   
16.1. today i started working on animations, sadly one  of the most time consuming concepts proved to be way to detailed for the size of the object in game, so even though its a really cool animation, i have to get rid of it for now and start fresh. 

17.1. I ended up reusing the overly detailed image for my canvas background as I really liked it. Then i proceeded to  change the way the ball reflects on the paddle, as before it would just flip the direction and angle, now based on the part of the paddle the ball lands on the angle differs. This took me most of the day.

18. 1. Next up I have added a functional reset button, Had some issues, especially with the text that shows once I press start drawing over each other etc.

On the weekend I have implemented the animation for the brick, a laughing bug, as well as added an on hit animation for the keyboard, so now it lights up when the ball collides with it. I made a new spritesheet for my ball, a simpler rotating face.

21. 1. To make the game feel a bit more whole I have created a progress player makes by clearing all bricks. Starting with one row each time player wins another row is added up to 4. once all these levels are cleared the number of rows resets to 1, but the speed of the ball increases, and player has to clear up to 4 rows with higher speed.
   
       22.1. I have worked on different win scenarios. One for clearing the rows, one for finishing max rows when the ball speeds up, and one as a final win. I have realized that endles attempts to win the game pose not much of a challenge, so I made a number of lives a player can lose. After all are gone, the player has to staart from beggining.

23.1. I decided to lower the number of attempts, but add special bricks that sometimes drop a heart that slowly falls, and if the player manages to catch it with the paddle they gain an extra attempt. I have added another lose scenario once the player loses all lives.

24.1. On this day I played with the audio and game effects for my game. added background music, hit sound effects, lose sounds win sounds etc.. I wanted my game to be funny, and i tried to give it as much character as I can as the principle of the game is fairly simple. I have adjusted velocities, max rows, speed etc., so its not too easy nor hard.
